GameMonster
===========

Game monster project is simply using DOTA concept.
in this project, there are characters and enchancers. 
just like in DOTA (Warcraft), Characters can be Hero or something else; in this case, character is a Here
(it can be something else - in advanced game monster) and a Hero can be Wizard, Warrior, etc. 
both Wizard and Warrior have their own unique capabilities, but as a Hero, they also have some similiarity.
they have HP, Mana, level, attack capability, damage, etc. they also can use enhancers (in this case, HP booster
and mana booster). 

and just run the program to see the result :-)
